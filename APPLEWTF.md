Apple has the following methods of identifying a device:
* The model number from the serial number. It's usually 3 or 4 digits.
* The model identifier; something like 'Macbook2,1'.
* The model number from the computer: A1181, for example.
* The order number. This looks like MC911LL/A, and internally we call it the model number.
* The sub-family name; Kind of like 'Mid 2007'.
* The EMC number, such as 2139.
